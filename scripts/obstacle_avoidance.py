.. module:: obstacle_avoidance
    :platform: Unix
    :synopsis: Python module for the obstacle avoidance
.. moduleauthor:: Ankur Kohli

This mode allows to use the robot in manual mode. The robot can be controlled with keyboards.
By receiving the inputs, the robot moves forward/backward, right/left. However, this mode tells
about the distance to the obtacles. Using the /scan to detect the walls around the robot.

Subscribes to:
 /laser_scan
 
Publishes to:
 /avoid
 
This node aims to activate a security feature for driving with the teleop_key modality. The *subscription* to the ``/laser_scan`` topic, the node will be able to get info about the robot's surroundings. The subscription to the topic will give back the ``ranges[0,720]`` array to the subscribed callback. This data structure contains the distance values between the robot and the surrounding walls for a span of 180ยบ degrees in front of the robot. The array simulates the info that a set of lasers would retrieve in an actual environment.

The node will later elaborate the data acquired to publish it on the ``custom_controller`` custom topic through the ``Avoid.msg`` custom message.
